Flow Cadence September bootcamp ðŸ’¥

## Chapter 1 - Day 1
- **Q.1 Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.**

    The Blockchain is an ledger where you store stuff/information such a way that it is nearly impossible to **HACK**.
    Which is not **OWNED** by any authority.
    And a great source to make **MONEY**.
- **Q.2 Explain what a Smart Contract is.**
    
    A Smart Contract is a set of instructions written through CODE by a so called **DEVELOPER**.
    It is fully **TRANSPERENT** means you can see the code of a Smart Contract and see what's happening in it, if you don't understand the contract programming language ***GOD HELP YOU.***
    
- **Q.3 Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

  **TRANSACTIONS** : Transaction in simple words means to call a function. When a transaction is called/excuted it **UPDATES** the data/state of the BLOCKCHAIN. For calling/exceution of a transaction the fees is to be paid which is known as **GAS FEES**.
  
  **SCRIPTS** : Script is used to **VIEW** the BLOCKCHAIN. Means It does not change the data or state of the BLOCKCHAIN it just **READS** it. And Scripts do not cost any MONEY for execution.
  
## Chapter 1 - Day 2

- **Q.1 What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**
 
    -  **SAFETY AND SECURITY**

    -  **CLARITY**
    -  **APPROACHABILITY**
    -  **DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE**
    -  **RESOURCE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING**

- **Q.2 In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful.**


    
    - **SAFETY AND SECURITY** It's very important because there will be users who will deposit there money and it should be SAFE and SECURE
    - **CLARITY** The code should be CLEAR and easy to read. The user should be able to know the intentions of the developer and verify it's SAFETY
    - **APPROACHABILITY** The language should be APROACHABLE so that a user with basic codeing language can also get the idea of what is happening.
    - **DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE** The developer should have good experience with the language/code. It should not **IRRITATE** the dev by not understandable errors.

## Chapter 2 - Day 1
   - **Q.1 Deploy a contract to account `0x03` called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a constant variable named `is`, and make it have type `String`. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.**

![Screenshot contract (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109747152/190894371-57080ad8-c6f0-45d1-bd93-3041034fa716.png)

- **Q.2 Check that your variable `is` actually equals "the best" by executing a script to read that variable. Include a screenshot of the output.**

![Screenshot script](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109747152/190894817-7b5b62c0-6f8c-4838-96af-1084b95f95ee.png)

## Chapter 2 - Day 2
 - **Q.1 Explain why we wouldn't call `changeGreeting` in a script.**
  
     Because SCRIPTS only view/reads the data. Therefore we called it in TRANSACTION.
    
 - **Q.2 What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?**
   
     To access the information/data in a account. 
     
- **Q.3 What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?**
       
    **PREPARE PHASE** :  To access the information/data in your account.
    
    **EXECUTE PHASE** : Call function to change the data on the blockchain
    
**CONTRACT EXCERISE**

- **Q.4 A variable named myNumber that has type `Int` (set it to 0 when the contract is deployed)**

**// CONTRACT**
```cadence
pub contract Numbers {
    pub var myNumber: Int

    pub fun updateMyNumber(newNumber: Int) {
      self.myNumber = newNumber
    }

    init() {
        self.myNumber = 0
    }
}
```
- **Q.5 Add a script that reads `myNumber` from the contract**

**// SCRIPT**
```cadence
import Numbers from 0x01

pub fun main(): Int {
    return Numbers.myNumber
}
```
- **Q.6 Add a transaction that takes in a parameter named `myNewNumber` and passes it into the `updateMyNumber` function. Verify that your number changed by running the script again.**

**// TRANSACTION**
```cadence
import Numbers from 0x01

transaction(myNewNumber: Int) {

  prepare(acct: AuthAccount) {}

  execute {
    Numbers.updateMyNumber(newNumber: myNewNumber)
  }
}
```
## Chapter 2 - Day 3

- **Q.1 In a script, initialize an array (that has length == 3) of your favourite people, represented as Strings, and log it.**

    **I have used "Animes" insted of "people"** ðŸ‘€
```cadence
    var Animes:[String] = ["Attack on Titan", "Tokyo Revengers", "Naruto"]
    log(Animes)
```
- **Q.2 In a script, initialize a dictionary that maps the Strings Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn to a UInt64 that represents the order in which you use them from most to least.**

```cadence
  var Socials: {String: UInt64} = {"Instagram": 7, "Facebook": 0, "Twitter": 10, "Youtube": 8}
  log(Socials)
```

- **Q.3 Explain what the force unwrap operator `!` is.**
    
   - It "UNWRAPS" the optional.Means Unless the thing is **NOT** `nil`, you are **Good to go**
   
- **Q.4 What the error message means, Why we're getting this error, How to fix it.**

    - It means that it is returning an optional.
    - Because we have used dictionaries and dictionaries return optional values.
    - Force unwarp it or change the return type to be an optional.
    
## Chapter 2 - Day 4
 
 - **Q.1 Deploy a new contract that has a Struct of your choosing inside of it.**
 - **Q.2 Create a dictionary or array that contains the Struct you defined.**
 - **Q.3 Create a function to add to that array/dictionary.**
 
 **// CONTRACT**
 ``` cadence
 pub contract Authentication {

    pub var Animes: [Anime]
    
    pub struct Anime {
        pub let name: String
        pub let account: Address

        init(_name: String, _account: Address) {
            self.name = _name
            self.account = _account

        }
    }

    pub fun addCat(name: String, account: Address) {
        let newCat = Anime(_name: name, _account: account)
        self.Animes.append(newCat)
    }

    init() {
        self.Animes = []
    }

}
```
- **Q.4 Add a transaction to call that function.**

**// TRANSACTION**
``` cadence
import Authentication from 0x01

transaction(name: String) {
    let address: Address

    prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
        self.address = signer.address
    }

    execute {
        Authentication.addCat(name: name, account: self.address)
        log("Anime added.")
    }
}
```
- **Q.5 Add a script to read the Struct you defined.**

**// SCRIPT**
``` cadence
import Authentication from 0x01

pub fun main(index: Int): Authentication.Anime {
    return Authentication.Animes[index]!
}
```
## Chapter 3 - Day 1
 - **Q.1 In words, list 3 reasons why structs are different from resources.**
   
   - They cannot be copied.
   - They cannot be lost.
   - Resources are more secure than structs.

 - **Q.2 Describe a situation where a resource might be better to use than a struct.**
    
    - While making a **Collection of NFTs**.

 - **Q.3 What is the keyword to make a new resource?**
    
    `create` is keyword to make a new resource.
    
 - **Q.4 Can a resource be created in a script or transaction (assuming there isn't a public function to create one)?**
 
    - **NO** It has to be created in the CONTRACT only.
    
 - **Q.5 What is the type of the resource below?**
     
     - `Jacob` is the type of the resource below.
     
 - **Q.6 Let's play the "I Spy" game from when we were kids. I Spy 4 things wrong with this code. Please fix them.**
```cadence
pub contract Test {

    // Hint: There's nothing wrong here ;)
    pub resource Jacob {
        pub let rocks: Bool
        init() {
            self.rocks = true
        }
    }

    pub fun createJacob(): Jacob { // there is 1 here
        let myJacob = Jacob() // there are 2 here
        return myJacob // there is 1 here
    }
}
```
**// FIXED**

``` cadence
pub contract Test {

    // Hint: There's nothing wrong here ;)
    pub resource Jacob {
        pub let rocks: Bool
        init() {
            self.rocks = true
        }
    }

    pub fun createJacob(): @Jacob { // there is 1 here
        let myJacob <- create Jacob() // there are 2 here
        return <- myJacob // there is 1 here
    }
}
```

## Chapter 1 - Day 1
- **Q.1 Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.**

    The Blockchain is an ledger where you store stuff/information such a way that it is nearly impossible to **HACK**.
    Which is not **OWNED** by any authority.
    And a great source to make **MONEY**.
- **Q.2 Explain what a Smart Contract is.**
    
    A Smart Contract is a set of instructions written through CODE by a so called **DEVELOPER**.
    It is fully **TRANSPERENT** means you can see the code of a Smart Contract and see what's happening in it, if you don't understand the contract programming language ***GOD HELP YOU.***
    
- **Q.3 Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.**

  **TRANSACTIONS** : Transaction in simple words means to call a function. When a transaction is called/excuted it **UPDATES** the data/state of the BLOCKCHAIN. For calling/exceution of a transaction the fees is to be paid which is known as **GAS FEES**.
  
  **SCRIPTS** : Script is used to **VIEW** the BLOCKCHAIN. Means It does not change the data or state of the BLOCKCHAIN it just **READS** it. And Scripts do not cost any MONEY for execution.
  
## Chapter 1 - Day 2

- **Q.1 What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?**
 
    -  **SAFETY AND SECURITY**
    -  **CLARITY**
    -  **APPROACHABILITY**
    -  **DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE**
    -  **RESOURCE ORIENTED PROGRAMMING**

- **Q.2 In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful.**
    
    - **SAFETY AND SECURITY** It's very important because there will be users who will deposit there money and it should be SAFE and SECURE
    - **CLARITY** The code should be CLEAR and easy to read. The user should be able to know the intentions of the developer and verify it's SAFETY
    - **APPROACHABILITY** The language should be APROACHABLE so that a user with basic codeing language can also get the idea of what is happening.
    - **DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE** The developer should have good experience with the language/code. It should not **IRRITATE** the dev by not understandable errors.
